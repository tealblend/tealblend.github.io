Dataworks Tutorial
---------

Dataworks is an IBM service that allows developers, data analyst, and business analyst to easily manage data preparations with ease through the use of their cloud based user interface. It allows to refine their data that fits their needs easily so that it saves them more time in refining data and more time in analyzing it.

In this tutorial we would need the following:

 - Dataworks Service
 - Any database service (e.g. dashDB, )

> Note: For this tutorial, we would be using dashDB service since it already contains sample data that we can use to manipulate with Dataworks.

#### **Step 1: Adding Dataworks and dashDB service** ####

 1. On your dashboard, click the **Services and APIs**.

 2. Look for **IBM Dataworks** and **dashDB** and add them to your dashboard.
 

> Note: You do not have to bind your Dataworks and dashDB to any application.


#### **Step 2: Establishing a connection to dashDB in Dataworks** ####

 1. Open Dataworks and dasDB in 2 separate windows.
 
 2. On the dashDB window, click the **Service Credentials** button and you will see different variables used such as port number, database name , and etc. We will be using some of the information of dashDB to establish a connection to Dataworks.
 
 3. On the Dataworks window, click the **Manage** button and from there click the <i class="icon-right-circled"></i> button in the right part of the screen.
